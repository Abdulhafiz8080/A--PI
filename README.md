The GUI is very limited (it has only on/off button), only just a list of toggleable scripts

## Developing New Scripts
You will need Visual Studio Code or other Text Editor
To Develop New Scripts:
1)Open the folder src in Visual Studio Code
2)Start writing new body.ts file inside another folder for example src/testscript/body.ts
After developing just rerun build.bat
and start.bat
